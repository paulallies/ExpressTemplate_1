So the index view is \r\n    missing.  Lets look under the views folder and see whats the problem.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    We do have an index view but it has a \"jade\" extension. Of course this was the \r\n    work of the expressjs scaffolding.  Let's change the extension to hbs to look \r\n    like \"index.hbs\".  We must also change the contents of the file to hbs syntax.\r\n    If we want to use a layout/master page we can add a layout.hbs to the views \r\n    folder or just rename the layout.jade to layout.hbs and change the syntax.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>What You'll Build</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    You'll implement a simple movie-listing application that supports creating, \r\n    editing, and listing movies from a database. Below are two screenshots of the \r\n    application youâ€™ll build. It includes a page that displays a list of movies \r\n    from a database: \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <img src=\"https://raw.github.com/paulallies/expressjsintro/master/tutorial/MovieList.png\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    The application also lets you add, edit, and delete movies, as well as see \r\n    details about individual ones. All data-entry scenarios include validation to \r\n    ensure that the data stored in the database is correct.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    <img src=\"https://raw.github.com/paulallies/expressjsintro/master/tutorial/Details.png\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Skills you will learn</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Here's what you'll learn:\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>How to create a new express project.</li>\r\n        <li>How to create routes and views.</li>\r\n        <li>How to create a new database using the MongoDB and Mongoose.</li>\r\n        <li>How to retrieve and display data.</li>\r\n        <li>How to edit data and enable data validation.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p>"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2708}]],"length":2708}
